### A Mediocre Setup Guide
If you just want to run the contents of the `dist` folder locally, then try this:
* Install VSCode
* Clone this repository
* Install the Live Server extension
* Right-click on index.html and click "run with Live Server"

If you want to compile any changes to the TypeScript files, do everything above and:
* Install npm? Not sure if VSCode comes with it by default
* Run this once: `npm install typescript ts-loader webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`
* Run this every time you want to compile: `npx webpack`
